This plugin will add a new menu item to the WordPress admin menu called "Local Theme Install". 
When you click on this menu item, you will be taken to a page where you can enter the path to the theme folder that you want to install. 
Once you have entered the path, click on the "Install Theme" button. 
The plugin will then copy the theme folder to the wp-content/themes directory and activate it.
